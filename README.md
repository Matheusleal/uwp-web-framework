# Universal Windows Platform web framework
Hello!

Welcome to Universal Windows Platform web framework.

Create web-based Universal Windows Platform applications in a blink of an eye! Use basic HTML syntax, and let UWP web framework do all the work for you!

It's for you if you:

- Know basic web technologies.
- Want to turn your website into a good looking Universal Windows Platform app.

## Demo
I have created a demo page, which at the same time serves as project's documentation. You can check it out here: [UWP web framework demo](http://projekty.wojtekmaj.pl/UWP_framework/).
